Configuration
=============

We share the same configuration structure for almost every possible environment.

We use:

- ``django-split-settings`` to organize ``django`` settings into multiple files and directories
- ``.env`` files to load secret configuration into different platforms


Components
----------

If you have some specific components like ``celery`` or ``mailgun`` installed, they could be configured in separate files. Just create a new file in ``server/settings/components/``. Then add it into ``server/settings/__init__.py``.


Environments
------------

To run ``django`` on different environments just specify ``DJANGO_ENV`` environment variable. It must have the same name as one of the files from ``server/settings/environments/``. Then values from this file will override other settings.


Local settings
--------------

If you need some specific local configuration tweaks, you can create file ``server/settings/environments/local.py.template`` to ``server/settings/environments/local.py``. It will be loaded into your settings automatically if exists.

.. code:: bash

  cp server/settings/environments/local.py.template server/settings/environments/local.py

See ``.template`` version for the reference.


Secret settings
---------------

You will need to copy file ``config/.env.template`` to ``config/.env``:

.. code:: bash

  cp config/.env.template config/.env


Secret settings in production
-----------------------------

We do not store our secret settings inside our source code.
All sensible settings are stored in ``config/.env`` file, which is not tracked by the version control.

So, how do we store secrets? We store them as secret environment variables in `GitLab CI <https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/ci/variables/README.html#secret-variables>`_.
Then we use `dump-env <https://github.com/sobolevn/dump-env>`_ to dump variables from both environment and ``.env`` file template.
Then, this file is copied inside ``docker`` image and when this image is built - everything is ready for production.

However, there are different options to store secret settings:

- `ansible-vault <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.4/vault.html>`_
- `git-secret <https://github.com/sobolevn/git-secret>`_
- `Vault <https://www.vaultproject.io/>`_

Depending on a project we use different tools. With ``dump-env`` being the default and the simplest one.

But the main idea is that we place these settings into ``config/.env`` file. So it would be easily readable for both ``docker`` and ``django``.
