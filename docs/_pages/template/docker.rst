Docker
======

Requirements
------------

``docker`` with version at least ``17.07`` or higher.


Development
-----------

To start development server inside ``docker`` you will need to run:

.. code:: bash

  docker-compose build
  docker-compose run web python manage.py migrate
  docker-compose up

You might want to tweak ``INTERNAL_IPS`` setting to include ``docker`` container into it. Otherwise ``django-debug-toolbar`` won't show up.

To get your ``docker`` ip run:

.. code:: bash

  docker inspect your-container-name | grep -e '"Gateway"'


Production
----------

You will need to specify extra configuration to run ``docker-compose`` in production. Since production build also uses ``caddy``, which is not required into the development build.

.. code:: bash

  docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker/docker-compose.prod.yml up -d


Going to production
-------------------

See :ref:`going-to-production` for more information.


Common issues
-------------

Pillow
~~~~~~

If you want to install ``Pillow`` that you should add this to dockerfile and rebuild image:

- ``RUN apk add jpeg-dev zlib-dev``
- ``LIBRARY_PATH=/lib:/usr/lib /bin/sh -c "test "$DJANGO_ENV" == production && pipenv install --system --deploy || pipenv install --dev --system --deploy"``

See `<https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/1763>`
