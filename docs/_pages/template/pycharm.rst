PyCharm
=======

We are using ``PyCharm`` for development.
It is an absolutely great tool.


One time setup
--------------

You will need to do a one time setup when you start to work on a project for the first time.

Editorconfig
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Firstly, you will need to install ``editorconfig`` plugin.
Go to: Settings -> Plugins.
Then search for ``editoconfig`` and install it.
You may need to restart a ``pycharm``.

Docker
~~~~~~

Secondly, you will need to create a remote ``docker`` interpreter for ``pycharm`` to run your code.

Go to: Settings -> Project -> Project Interpreter -> Add Remote.
Then select "Docker Compose". Select `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose.override.yml` as configuration files and `web` as a service.
You are done.

This project ships with prebuild configuration for development server and tests. So, when interpreter will be ready, you can hit ``runserver-docker`` to start the server.
Everything should run correctly.


Running development server
--------------------------

Whenever you start a new project there will be several configurations available to you:

- ``runserver-docker``, which starts local ``docker-compose`` suited for development
- ``test-docker``, which starts tests on local ``docker-compose``

Just select any of these targets and execute them.


Deployment
----------

Deployment via ``PyCharm`` is not supported intentionally. And never will be.


Alternatives
------------

Some developers prefer to run local build without ``docker`` since it is faster and proven to be 100% stable.

It is now not configured by default. You have to configure it yourself.


Known issues
------------

- It may break in various parts, it is not 100% stable yet
- Your server will be available at ``http://127.0.0.1:8000/``, not ``http://0.0.0.0:8000/`` as ``PyCharm`` says
- It requires ``PyCharm 2017``, other versions will not work
