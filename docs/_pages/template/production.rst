Production
==========

We deploy our application using ``docker-compose`` files with version ``3`` and ``docker swarm``.


Setting up
----------

Making sure that ``overlay2`` driver is used (which is recommended):

.. code:: bash

  docker info | grep 'Storage Driver'

If it does not return anything, then `you have to configure <https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/storagedriver/overlayfs-driver/#configure-docker-with-the-overlay-or-overlay2-storage-driver>`_ ``overlay2`` driver by yourself.

Creating a single file for deployment:

.. code:: bash

  docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker/docker-compose.prod.yml config > docker-compose.deploy.yml

Activating ``swarm`` mode (this command should be run only once per host):

.. code:: bash

  docker swarm init


Running
-------

To actually deploy a software run:

.. code:: bash

  docker stack deploy --compose-file docker-compose.deploy.yml my-app-name


Updating already running service
--------------------------------

If you need to update an already running service, them you will have to use ``docker service update`` or ``docker stack deploy``.

Updating existing `service <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/service_update/>`_.
Updating existing `stack <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/stack_deploy/>`_.
